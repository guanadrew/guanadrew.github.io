# Projects

I've done a lot of projects over my engineering education, some good, some unmentionable. Here's a choice list, with links if you'd like to learn more.

### eDrum Pedal – In Progress

With a lot of time on my hands and a big new sound system, I hope to perform some cool 
DSP on an Arduino and send it through the speakers with the UDA1334a DAC.

### [Machine Vision on Budget FPGA – May 2025](assets/pdfs/TinyML_projectPoster.pdf){:target="_blank"}

I worked with a team of engineering TAs to build this simple image classifier on a $30 FPGA. The hope was to inspire underclassmen
to learn about AI through hardware, not just hyped-up LLMs. We wanted something interesting but feasible, so trained a simple MLP to
classify handwritten digits through an OV7670 camera. I learned a lot about neural networks, memory in hardware, and how to integrate
peripherals like the camera and VGA display. 

### [BEATs Hero Bucket – May 2025](assets/pdfs/beats-hero.pdf){:target="_blank"}

To complete my Music Engineering minor and honor BEATs (Tufts' premier street drumming club), I made a video game and controller out of
a Raspberry Pi and a bucket from Home Depot.

### [Photonic Nanoscale Wave Controller – April 2025](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Utj6oasEBiss1Qc4LMoK2R1117ODrWuYDAH555PjyVw/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1){:target="_blank"}

Most of the work on this project was during my sophomore summer through Tufts' Summer Scholars grant, which funds undergraduate research. I'm putting
it further up because, through special effort of Daniel Harrington, this work was recently published as part of [his paper in Optics Express!](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-33-8-18197&id=570316){:target="_blank"} I worked at the Mohanty Nanophotonics Lab to investigate the practicality of optical beam steering (aiming a laser, essentially) using wave superposition. While techniques are relatively advanced at telecom frequencies, the Mohanty Lab is driving forward new technology at visible wavelengths for lots
of quantum and biomedical applications.

### [Smack Buds – December 2022](https://github.com/wildlyons99/smash_buds){:target="_blank"}

I worked primarily on the game and controller logic for a retro fighting game entirely in VHDL. We communicated with an NES controller over a simple serial protocol to an Upduino FPGA, which outputs the game to a VGA display.
