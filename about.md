# About

This site is a relatively recent project to serve as both my professional portfolio and personal website. As I have many people with whom I'd like to stay connected and am rather nonparticipant in social media, it can act as a useful means of keeping them apprised of my life. And as I am currently applying to employers who need full and well-considered pictures of their potential employees, both technically and personally, it will be useful to have a complete virtual portrait of these qualities. While technology is so currently hindering our capacity to connect – whether in the AI crisis or social media addiction – I believe this project is an appropriate and appreciable use of modern social technology.

I am a recent graduate of [Tufts University](https://engineering.tufts.edu/ece){:target="_blank"}, where I majored in Electrical Engineering with a Music Engineering minor. 
At school, my focus was split between embedded firmware and core physics (optics and acoustics). I love technical roles with a socially conscious mission, and have pursued experience in engineering for medicine, music, and renewable energy. 

Since I could read I read constantly, several books a month, and have [always loved writing](https://dcohencreations.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"}. I have always wanted to publish a book – I can use this site as a literary blog or to self-publish a serial. In my heart, I am most interested in stories, the stories of fiction, physics, and people. The genres change, but the purpose is preserved. I also find great purpose in music, and have been practicing the drums for over ten years. Since sophomore year of high school, I have consistently played music in a band of friends and have performed live on radio, for school events, and at local bars and clubs. More recently, I have acquired some massive, awesome passive speakers and an old receiver. Wiring the sound system was a great joy and playing lossless CDs through great speakers was otherworldly... at the intersection of my love of music and electricity, I've aimed my employment pursuits the most towards audio electronics. I can join a band, and use this site to promote my shows or eventually recorded sound.

At any rate, I moved to Berkeley, CA in July 2025 to seek a job, friends, and my general fortune. I'm still looking!
