# About Me

I am a recent graduate of Tufts University, where I majored in Electrical Engineering with a Music Engineering minor. 
At school, my focus was split between embedded firmware and core physics (optics and acoustics).

In my heart, I am most interested in stories – the stories of fiction, physics, and people. The genres change, but the meaning is preserved.

I moved to Berkeley, CA in July 2025 to seek a job, friends, and my general fortune. I'm still looking!
